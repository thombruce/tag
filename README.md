# Thom's Guide to Dual-booting Arch Linux on a Windows 11 Machine

## Step 0: Are you Thom?

0. Is your name Thom? If not, this guide probably isn't for you!

No, seriously, I'm writing this guide before I've even begun the process - sort of a _measure twice, cut once_ sort of thing.
The steps here are going to be super specific to my current machine.
This guide will be outdated and redundant for even myself in the future.
Might update later, who knows!
